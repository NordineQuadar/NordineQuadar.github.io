<p>
    Hey there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my spot on the web! 
</p>
<p>
    I'm like a mix of an engineer and a researcher, always curious and trying new things. I started my academic journey at the University of Ottawa, where I studied electrical engineering and computer science for my bachelor's and master's degrees. 
</p>
<p>
    For over a decade now, I've cultivated rich experiences across diverse industries and global landscapes. From my early days in field service roles to assuming technical leadership positions, I've navigated the compelex challenges of life and real-world engineering with resilience and adaptability.
</p>
<p>
    But here's the cool part: I've always had this itch for learning. After finishing up my master's under the supervision of Prof. Claude D'Amours., I thought, why not keep the momentum going? So, I dove into the Ph.D. adventure in Wireless security at the Military College of Canada, with Prof. Abdellah Chehri as my mentor.
